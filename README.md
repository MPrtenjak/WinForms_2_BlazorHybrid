# WinForms_2_BlazorHybrid

In this GitHub repository, I will guide you through the process of upgrading a legacy C# WinForms application with Blazor Hybrid.

## Important Note:

**Before we proceed, it's crucial to understand the following points:**

* To ensure clarity, I will use a minimal application instead of a large code repository.
* Each step of the upgrading process will be thoroughly documented as one GIT commit
* For convenience, each commit will also include an accompanying EXE file, allowing you to observe the upgrading process without the need to build the program.

## Upgrading Process:
Considering the scenario where we have a significant WinForms application with extensive code but needing more tests, it would be wise to make drastic changes and hope for the best outcome. Instead, we aim to introduce minimal modifications to minimize the risk of breaking anything.

## Selecting the Initial Project
To illustrate the upgrading process, I randomly selected a project from the internet. The chosen project exemplifies the typical characteristics of a legacy application. These applications are often disorganized, lacking best practices, and written by multiple developers using different patterns over an extended period. 

The selected app is, of course, written by one developer and is small. But pretend that it is a big, poorly written app.

__Under no circumstances do I insult or mean anything bad to the original developer. His application was chosen at random because it meets the described conditions!__

## Selected Application
For this demonstration, I obtained the application from the webpage https://www.sourcecodester.com/tutorials/c/12232/c-simple-crud-application-sqlite.html. The source code is available in a zip file.

__Please note that this repository aims to provide insights into the upgrading process and should not be considered a comprehensive solution for every legacy application scenario.__
